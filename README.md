# Simple-Coins Minecraft Mod

This is my first attempt at a Minecraft Mod. I wanted to try out Minecraft modding so here is all the code for it.

This repo is no longer being maintained. Some of the code is most likely bad, or there are better ways to do somethings. All in all, it was a fun project. I recommend trying out modding for Minecraft if you're interested in Game Development or Game Design.
